Feature: Content Context
  In order to be able to use our custom ContentContext class
  As a developer
  I want to be sure that all the steps defined within are working correctly.

  Background:

      | administrator  | john@example.com           | administrator  |
      | page_editor    | page_editor@example.com    | page_editor    |
      | article_editor | article_editor@example.com | article_editor |

    Given page content:
      | title          | body             |
      | My first page  | First page body  |
      | My second page | Second page body |

    Given article content:
      | title             | body                |
      | My first article  | First article body  |
